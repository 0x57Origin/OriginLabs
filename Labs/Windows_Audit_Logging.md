# Windows Logging & Event Detection
---
## We will enable windows audit policy on a Windows 11 VM and also detect failed logins attempts - NIST 800-171: 3.3.1
---
### We need to check if the audit logging is even on first! (audit policy)
-> Open PowerShell @admin and type: auditpol /get /category:*
    /get /category:* -> This just dumps all the audit policy to the terminal

```
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> auditpol /get /category:*
